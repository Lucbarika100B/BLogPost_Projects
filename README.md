# Email Spam Classification with Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use logistic regression for classifying emails into spam or ham (non-spam). It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insightful visualizations.

## Prerequisites

You need Python installed, with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- wordcloud

Install via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Spam Classification

1. Place your dataset file `email.csv` in the project folder.
2. Link to dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashfakyeafi/spam-email-classification
3. Run the script using:
```bash
python spam_classifier.py
```

## Results and Visualizations

The script provides:
- Spam vs Ham messages distribution (bar chart)
- Word clouds for Spam and Ham messages
- Spam detection accuracy
- Confusion matrix for clear visualization of prediction accuracy

# Linear Regression for House Price Prediction

This simple Linear Regression project predicts house prices based on given features (e.g., size, location).

##  Prerequisites

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Running the Linear Regression

1. Download your dataset (e.g., Boston housing dataset or any similar CSV).
2. Run the script using:
```bash
python linear_regression.py
```

##  Outputs

The script will:
- Predict house prices
- Display the accuracy of predictions
- Provide a visualization of predicted vs actual values
